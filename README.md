Abivote
=======

*The Go template files (`.html`) are localised in German, as are other user-directed strings.*

Abivote is a specialised Go HTTP server for taking surveys. It allows free-form questions
where the user is expected to write an answer into a text field (*text questions*) and
also supports multiple-choice questions realised through radio buttons (*radio questions*).

To operate the server, create text and radio questions, compile the server and run `abivote`.
View the statistics under `http://my-server-name.com:8080/stats`. Then sigh at the lack of
documentation because the project is very much specialised at the moment. Sorry!

As is custom in German gymnasia (highest level of school), the pupils prepare an Abiturzeitung
in their last year before taking the Abitur (cf. A-levels); it is a form of student publication
and often incorporates the results of a large survey taken by the pupils; the questions are rather
humorous.
